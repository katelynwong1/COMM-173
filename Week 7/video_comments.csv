We had chicken for dinner, and used the rest through the weekend for sandwiches, salads or soup or casseroles, enchiladas, etc. Delicious and inexpensive.

I remember pointing out to one of my co-workers how good they were, and this was when I worked in Totem Lake which was from 1993 to 2001.

This is when a store intentionally sells a product for less than what it costs them to put it on the shelf in order to attract customers who will usually buy something else while they're there. Grocery stores do this with milk.

I worked at Best Buy when the PlayStation 3 came out. I noticed we were actually selling them for a little less than what we were purchasing them for. Some of the computers too. Turns out the profit margins are so high on the accessories and games that they were willing to take a small loss if it meant another consumer to buy all of those extras.

One year my boss gave all his employees $100 gift card to Costco as part of our Christmas bonus. I used over half of my card to simply purchase the rotisserie whole chicken.

They place the section in a section of the store that makes it clear you walk by as much items as possible, to entice potential additional purchases. And in Wincos case, they keep their prices low by requiring certain fried chicken sets (we add these drums and wings for example always at a specific ratio) and to minimize waste as well. They also sell their fried chicken cold for a often more expensive price. 
Just wanted to bring it up because I considered similar context, and also I know there's other viewers out there that go to Winco Foods that dont often consider that factor in the northwest.

The reason why they sold the roasted chicken and cheap hot dogs was because of the long travel time for its customers. Back when they started Costco's were sparse. And sometimes you'd have to drive 45 minutes or more on the interstate. The cheap food sold at a loss was something for it's customers between the shopping and the long travel home. The rotisserie chicken was also part of that idea. A take away to be enjoyed at home for cheap. Also, back in the early 90's, the chicken was 3.99.

This is the point at which the demand and supply curves in the market intersect, and it's also where profit is maximized. That's why it's not always better to raise prices or lower them.

Costco wants you to keep coming back and buying a freshly cooked chicken and just about everything else you see. If you stock up on uncooked chicken, it's unlikely you'll be back in multiple times for other items.

I have gone there when there were none left, and they told me it will be 2.5 hours until new ones are ready. They seem to have no concept of thinking ahead, they wait until they run out, then put new ones in the rotisserie.

I save the debris (skin, bones, and juice in the container) as the start for a chicken and sausage gumbo by placing it into a pot, adding enough water (or boxed chicken stock) to cover it and simmer for 30+ minutes.  Pour the debris and liquid through a fine mesh strainer, placed over a large measuring cup.  Discard the debris, let the liquid cool, cover, and place in the fridge for a few hours or overnight and the next day skim the fat from the top.  At this point I either freeze the liquid or add it to my roux, along with the reserved chicken meat and continue cooking my gumbo.

No no! Do not toss that remaining carcass.  Throw that into a pot with about 6+ cups of water (enough to cover), bring to a boil, and simmer for a few hours.

I can definitely understand where people are coming from. There was subtle chemical taste, which may not be noticed by most people. I also noticed that there was a part of the leg that was particularly strong in chemical taste. I read a comment somewhere that it was a cleaning chemical Costco used to disinfect rotating rods. I'm inclined to believe this. I think the part of the leg was wrapped around the rod and picked up more of the chemical flavor. If this is what's causing the issue, then it may be best to buy their chicken later in the day. I bought mine at 11 AM.

This taste is due to a disinfectant that is used to clean equipment and preparation surfaces, and I don't believe it is chlorine bleach. They wipe down surfaces with this stuff, whatever it is, then fail to rinse or wipe down with plain water. A soft-serve ice cream place that I once frequented made a batch without rinsing the cleaner out of the equipment. It was uneatable. I threw it away, and never went back. Some places like Taco Bell and pizza joints slide the food down the stainless steel counter, and the food picks-up the off taste if cleaning was improperly done. Food service workers may have even been told they don't need to rinse after using this product. A quick look at food service disinfectants sold on Amazon show that they brag about not needing rinsing. Sure, if you don't mind your food tasting like disinfectant.

My parents belonged to Costco since the late 1980s. I loved to get samples as a teen and talk to the sample people.  I didn't take all samples because I'm a picky eater.

In 19990s Costco opened closer to my parents and they went there a lot more. I sometimes went with my parents to buy my own food.

Costco has good memories for me.

And at my two favorite Costco's I have not noted anything except great taste and the chickens are well above the 3 lb. minimum weight. Just a moment of science, chlorine water is regular water with chlorine gas infused (like at pools) a few hours after release of the water, the gas is released, and no chlorine is still there. Some friends that catered parties gave me the clew to soak my lettuce in the sink filled with water and a cap full of non-flavored bleach and the results were amazing. Give it a try, no Clorine smell.

But, I'd never leave Costco without buying 1 or 2 of them, one for that night and one I stick in the freezer for a quick meal later, (let the bashing begin). Yes, it's not as good as buying it fresh buy if you've ever been in a pinch and hate fast food, a frozen Costco chicken defrosted in the fridge overnight still tastes better than some supermarket brands. As far as the crispy skin, sure it's not crispy but, the kids still fight over it at the table and, if you've ever noticed, the one's in the supermarket that are actually labeled crispy rotisserie chicken are also the ones that are dry and overcooked AF. Will definitely try making the stock with my next Costco carcass.

It's an essential mineral/electrolyte required for blood pressure regulation. Kidneys need it to regulate blood volume. Any excess the kidneys will dump out with urine. The recommendation of restricting sodium does more harm than good. Problem is that people eat too much sugar and refined carbs. Hyperinsulinemia activates angiotensin II rennin causes kidneys to increase blood pressure. Electrolytes imbalance of magnesium and potassium will result in hypertension as well. But it's much easier to blame sodium than address the real cause.

Is this just a Costco commercial? They compare an entire Wendy's ""Baconator"", which is 8 oz of beef alone, plus bacon, cheese, and bread to a 3 oz piece of Chicken??? Who even eats a tiny 3 oz piece of Rotisserie Chicken. Even if you are on a serious diet you're probably eating 4oz. I assure you gram for gram, there is little difference in the sodium between this Costco chicken and the ""Baconator"". I find Costco chickens to be kinda dry - HEB (in Texas) has a much better roasted bird, although smaller and more expensive.

We get the Wal-mart type and it did go up from what it was before. If we get them cold or not freshly cooked they mark them down to 3.99 or up. Before fresh ones sold for 3.99 and when cold 1.50 it just depends on the expiration dates. The fresher it is the more it cost :) enjoy from your fam in small town Ohio ^_^

I'm retired from Costco working there for over 26 years. It's good that you put comments in the comment box (usually found at the front of the store as you are leaving). They love to hear from their members and you help to educate them on what people want. Have your friends fill them out too, the more the better. Just remember that they have to find a good supplier and there has to be a good demand. Also you can ask at the Membership desk if they are just out of something and waiting for the shipment or if it is seasonal. The grass fed burgers have been a regular item at our store.

He was able to add things such as ""free range chickens""...which is just opening a door with a fence to allow them ""access"" to outside, though none went out. ""No antibiotics""...well that's already illegal. In total he added about 6 or 7 ""feel good"" labels but in actually they really meant nothing or had no effect as all chickens are raised the same.

They live and travel up and down the coast. After some Norwegian fishfarm companies got permission to set up open net salmon farms scientists who track these pods started to notice that when a pod went to travel past these areas, they would veer off to get as far away from them as possible to get past them. So if the water around these nets is so toxic , I'm going to take the advise of the orcas and stay away. These fish farms pollute the water the same as a factory farmer pollutes the land. The Canadian government has withdrawn the licenses and they have to be completely gone by 2022. We are ecstatic.

I already knew all this information about meat/seafood but I’m so glad your getting the information out there for people who have no idea about meat practices, feed, and what’s added. I hope Costco will continue to provider it’s savvy shoppers higher quality meat options and more organic. Paying a premium for a membership should come with better options. As a Physician Assistant who’s done a lot of research on nutrition and holistic health, I just want to say spot on and good job explaining all of this. And one more thing, most people buy the rotisserie chicken because they leave exhausted and hungry and it’s a quick fast option for many. I don’t like the idea of getting non-organic poultry. Suggestion for Costco: prepare some organic rotisserie chicken for higher $$ and let people chose. I would pay more for an organic rotisserie chicken already cooked. Great content! Keep informing people and hopefully one day we can ban Glyphosate/Monsanto/Roundup/GMO and all practices creating TOXIC FOOD.

Thank you so much for posting. I've noticed that my family and I are already making good choices. Honestly, I thought I ate pretty healthy until I got my cancer diagnosis last spring. After treatment, My doctor said that the major thing I could do is Change things in my diet. I wasn't eating organic because it is more expensive. But ever since we got our Costco membership, we've been in food heaven. The savings has been great. But the most important thing is that it's made it SO much easier for us to buy Organic and actually stick to it. I love these videos and am about to search for more.

The Costcos in my area (Central Valley California-Stockton, Modesto, Manteca) started removing the spinalis just from the prime ribeye (not from the Choice) about a year ago and began selling them separately at a higher price (now they are both the same price). (They use to have both the intact prime ribeye and spinalis before that but they discontinued the spinalis for awhile and later resorted to just getting the spinalis from the prime ribeyes they were selling. A disservice to prime ribeye fans who relish the spinalis part of the ribeye.) 

I found this to be such a conniving, deceitful, practice (when it was priced higher than the ribeye) that I stopped buying the prime ribeye altogether. Now, with the pandemic, both prime ribeyes and spinalis meat are just over the top at about $22/lbs. in my area so buying them isn't really in the best interest of my pocket book when I can get it at my local steak restaurants for about the same price and with loads of side dishes.

I wonder which Costco you were at (?) because I've seen other recent Costco shopping videos that still sell the prime ribeye intact, without stealing the spinalis off of them to be sold separately. This led me to believe they were just doing it at the lesser affluent cities because the videos that showed intact ribeyes were in more influential cities.

Other than gas, I use the pharmacy and I bought tires there, but for food, I always go to Sams. Pretty much every food item is cheaper at Sams. You may find specials at Costco, and they carry higher end goods on some things than Sams club, but for food, Sams club is definitely cheaper.

And I love the 4.99 chickens. Otherwise I think the meats are pretty overpriced and not particularly tender, even with the blade tenderization. And I agree, blade tenderizing steaks is a terrible idea. Fred Meyer is usually a very good price for their meat
The interesting thing about costco ground beef is that it expires the next day. It's all the beef that will expire tomorrow tossed in the grinder with some extra fat. That means your burger could be prime rib or tenderloin. It's also incredibly lean. You do have to be able to use it very quickly or freeze it that day though.

Most often they are full of sodium tripolyphosphate (STP or STPP), which is a salt that adheres itself to the cells causing them to retain water. It's used by the food industry to add weight to the food for more profit. It cannot be washed out, and can only be removed by heating, hence the white glue-like ooze that comes out of seafood when cooked. It's hard to find seafood without STP. I've checked Costo's shrimp and it's on the label. Check the unpeeled, as they sometimes don't have it but the peeled will most often. Also, scallops are known as ""wet"" (with STPP) or ""Dry"" (without STPP)...so obviously dry is best and will sear in a pan instead of steam.

Additionally, not having the label doesn’t necessarily mean inhumane. Unless you can verify yourself. As mentioned by the person in the video, labeling is a tricky and sneaky business. 

The only label I’m concerned with is the one given by the USDA. Even then, things slip through the cracks.

Love me some COSTCO. Although you did an excellent job in this section I have a couple issues. First...I love catfish, bottom feeder or not, and just because you don't like it you should still give use catfish lovers the same quality review as you would the salmon lovers. Btw....I'm a mad seafood lover and if I had my choice it would be seafood all day every day except when I need my bacon fix. So....whats a good type of catfish to buy and where? Would going to a wharf or getting fresh fish be better for everyone? Secondly, you ran by the Tilapia so fast, once again because you don't like it, that I didn't even hear a word about where or what kind to buy that was good for you. Thanks for the Costco shop through....I'm just loving it.

Still buy a little lamb at Costco and some fish occasionally. However my chickens and ducks I go direct to the hutterites also get amazing free range eggs. Bought myself a vacuum sealer big investment however the savings I making by doing my own poultry and meats it is already paid for itself. I get a side of beef from a rancher fully grass fed no chemicals or drugs superior product. I’m about to go out in the next week to pick up my side of beef from the farm and I’m getting out at four Canadian dollars a pound. Also picked up a whole pig, A lot cheaper than Costco. A little while back at a friends birthday party I met a German butcher and he does my butchering for me I go in and help out too so I’m learning as I go I’m also making my own sausages and I’ve even started the cure my own meats making things like shoulder of bacon back rashers and of course streaky rashers think I’m going to try and make a corn beef. Instead of going to the supermarket I think people should start doing this they know exactly where the food is coming from it takes a little work in a little effort but it is real good home economics as you do save some money it just takes a bit more of an effort and a little bit of logistics figuring out. Still go to Costco for some bits and pieces however in the last couple years a lot less than I used to particularly I think a lot of the businesses are overcharging us quite considerably for our food. I walked into a grocery store two weeks ago and they wanted $15 for a rutabaga are you kidding me.

Totally agree, stay away from most Asian seafood ALL there. Any Fish and particular Seafood, they are feed from the same fish pool they swim in, AKA eat their own feces, then processed. Anything previous ""frozen"", means just that, tay away from. Another one to stay away from is, wherever you buy buns, a 12 pack there is a Best before date, however you think no, I only want 4. Well Stores will take the dozen, unpack them into 4's now getting 3 pk's, and heres the kicker, the store then changes the best before and packaged that day,WHY cause law tells them they're following standards. So there's lots of trick that shoppers may not beware of. I've been in food processing for years.

Also, those prime steaks that said blade tenderized on the label haven't been passed through a mechanical tenderizer. If they had they would be thinned out and flattened out and would have tons of small shallow poke holes throughout them. I worked in a grocery store meat market with a cutting room where we tenderized meats through the machine, so yeah... You'd definitely know if a cut has been tenderized through the machine or with a mallet. My guess is the description/handling section of those label are outdated with the only change made to them being the designation of the cut and the price per pound, which is pretty common with grocery store labels.

It is a foreign resource packaged in the US only.  That labeling appears on any & all foreign meat & fish products under the Obama administration in 2015.  Foreign raw meats became avail in the US in his first administration in 2009. Before 2009 no meat or fish sold raw was anything other than US raised, processed & packaged in the US.
I highly suspect a large portion of Costco meats are from foreign countries, which is why US meat purveyors are marketing their brand labels, look for USDA, not ""Product of USA"".

If you're taking pieces of meat and wrapping them in a pinwheel for a larger piece, then what used to be on the outside edges (possibly covered in bacteria) is now on the inside.  Cooking ""non blade tenderized"" cuts rare (like I do) isn't too far a cry away from being ""blade tenderized"".  I agree with your other points but I've personally never known anyone to get sick from what you're saying.  It is something to think about though.

They no longer have the deals they used to and most of the stuff you're can be bought elsewhere for less. Many are or deceived into believing they're getting a better deal because they're buying it in large quantities, but the reality is you can get it cheaper in the supermarkets. milk is a perfect example. we buy a gallon of milk for $1.69. But at Costco they sell it for 4.79 for 2 gallons so it's more expensive to shop there. Or many other items in their warehouse that are cheaper at other grocers. Costco is no longer competitive on many items that are available cheaper and in other stores. They called them selves a wholesaler but seriously, who are they selling wholesale prices to? Not you or me.

Plus grass is different in  different regions of the country so you can not  compare how it will even taste. It takes much longer for cattle to gain weight for marbling on grass.  Grain fed beef tastes better and is more expensive to feed the cattle  than grass. Grain and feed companies have scientists getting the best nutrition to the animals.   Purina Animal Nutrition Research farm ,  science leader in this field who studies all the nutrition going into the cattle.   Who is researching the grass?  Is that grass dry or healthy. Is it sprayed , does it has a fungus, what is its quality? 
Deer hunters go to states with great foliage and  field corn in fields because the meat tastes better.  Taste a hamburger in Hawaii where most are grass fed to a juicy burger from cattle raised with excellent nutrition fed in Iowa. 
Why so many people are pulled into the grass fed idea is an example how gullible we are under good marketing or a fad mentality. I just need to see scientific evidence that grass is better!

Euell promoted eating wild, healthy food, died at age 64, but looked 90. I grew up in CA, and lived the past 30 years in TX. Two states that raised most cattle. I've eaten many a cows in 74 years and never even know all this 'bull' existed until 'political correct' applies to food. How do you treat cows, turkey, and chicken with kindness when they are ultimately slaughtered for human consumption. I see cows lined up to get smacked by the large sledge hammer and then move on to get carved up. So treating them with kindness and respect makes him sleep better at night after he swallowed that prime steak. I am sure many vegetarians and animal rights group will side with him. I pray the wind don't blow the corn pollen from one field to the another and came up with a weird species. God forbid now it's called cross-pollinating.

I work on an organic ranch and the standards are very high. We can't use anything that doesn't meet organic standards. It is a very expensive process. No GMO's, nothing that doesn't meet standards of the USDA designation for organics. Everything in the organics world is about three times more expensive than if you just ran conventional. To pack for Costco, we have to meet higher standards than even USDA. Just thought I would throw that out there for anyone wondering.

Not so much. If it is feed a vegetarian diet, it’s not the complete diet the bird was designed to eat. Part of the natural diet for these birds are bugs, worms, etc. The only way you are going to get a bird that was raised the way nature intended is to raise your own, or get it from a local farmer that you can visit to verify you’re getting a bird raised the way you think it is raised. If the price is cheap, it’s not what you think no matter what it says. Large scale farmers can’t afford the costs of raising birds out doors in the conditions that are more natural for it. They simple don’t get that much money for their products. If you’re buying at a large chain store, you’re getting a bird raised as cheaply as possible. As for “Farm” raised seafood. No matter what they say, it’s not sustainable. The dirty little secret they don’t tell you is the oceans are rapped for all the small fish they can get to feed these farms. Fish are designed to eat other fish smaller than they are. Not grains, but fish. I just hate seeing people taken advantage of with marketing BS! Don’t fall for it.

Regardless of whether you shop at Costco or a fish market, there is no salmon that is currently safe.  Farm raised Salmon is the worst with mushy meat and supposedly wild caught salmon is contaminated with what is flowing from Fukushima.  Almost all sea food choices at Costco are a no no.  There is only one fish they have that is not often carried and that is New Zealand Hoki.  AND, don't ever buy already breaded fish or meat, because you have no idea what type of contamination their coatings have covered up.
2.)  No ""Organic Chicken"" is not better, because the term is falsely applied, because the word ""organic"" doesn't mean shit when it comes to chicken.  The best you could hope for is that maybe term ""Organic"" means they were raised without antibiotics.  I'm 73 and have been eating Foster Farms chicken for over 50 years and have suffered no issue from it.  Actually do some research on what organic means to the chicken industry.  It is actually a bull shit term used to confuse the buyer into thinking it is more healthy than are Foster Farms chicken.  Also chicken legs at $1.79 per pound is so over the top I will not buy them, I don't care if that label says organic or not.  Why, because I used to be a meat cutter and I know what meat should cost.
3.)  I am only 1/4 the way through the video and have opted to stop.  Apparently this guy is being paid by Costco because he is a little too effusive about the supposed good pricing, and I don't want to have to tell you the truth about what else he says about the different grades of beef, or pork.  The Lamb Costco carries taste like crap and is imported of course and was more than likely previously frozen.  If you want a good price on your chicken purchase one of Costco's already cooked birds, they are the best and are only about $5.00 each which is a steal.
I'm out of here.

""if you can't find pasture raised the organic is fine"" lol but you're afraid of a chicken eating shit? A pasture raised chicken eats shit fyi... lol and the beef stickers about ""blade tenderized"" are just a box store being lazy ️ it's on every sticker so they dont have to make multiples lol just look at the meat, it was not tenderized.
All beef, unless done in small custom batches, is grain finished, a steer slaughtered off ""grass"" is finished with dry grain because a steer on green tastes horrible, hope you do a little research in the future ️

Yes they will scavenge previously dead animals but so will most fish. However, they prefer to eat live food wherever possible. But more interestingly, you immediately went over to the Alaskan King Crab and put your stamp of approval on them...talk about bottom feeders! and scallops too! another bottom feeder. All they ever eat is dead and decaying flesh. You need to get more informed, Bobby.

Who made this guy an expert?  Ground turkey used to be from thigh meat, now it comes from comminuted meat.  It all is horrible (ever notice that ground turkey is watery to the touch in the container as well as in raw state out of the package, it is the mechanical deboning process that does that.  there is no muscle striation to be gathered by comminuting.  Also, get educated man.  That logo for Certified Humane (on first package) is not the gold standard program by HFAC, it is not correct verbiage, not a 3rd party verified program.  The second call out is.

Dude, Australian, New Zealand lamb just plain sucks.  Go for the USDA Spring Fed Lamb,  domestic lamb cannot be beat.  Not gamy at all.

Jacard is not used in all states because according to some local food safety laws, by using a Jacard machine the meat must be sold as non-intact muscle.  If it is cooked in a restaurant it needs to be cooked to over 160 degrees.  The reason they are Jacarding at all is that they do not age their meat so without the benefit of wet aging, the connective tissue and natural enzymatic breakdown of the muscle is not given time to make more tender, hence Jacarding.  And you are greatly mistake if you think that Grading has anything to do with tenderness.  Scientific fact, read CSU documentation on aging protocols.  You can cook to any temp you want but for liability concerns, they are going to all out cooking times.  You need to get educated on ingredient statements.

Organic does not mean it is a product of the USA, it just means that the meat was verified to be Organic.  You should be an advocate for reinstating the COOL packaging requirement that went out the window during Obama era.  Consumers don't know much and this was an end around for Canadian beef (nearly 100% barley fed) and Mexican beef (which I call poison resulting form the high levels of beta agonists used in the feed).

Get educated and be of service to your subscribers, you could do with a real life walk through Costco by someone who can help educate you so you can pass it on.  Foodie; over informed, under educated.

Studies have not confirmed that livestock raised with genetically engineered feed have any statistically significant health effects on human beings. Also, organic farming, despite popular belief is worse for the environment. According to a 2018 study by Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, it was discovered that when all factors were taken into account the farming of organic peas versus non-organic peas resulted in an approximately 50% jump in climate impact. This is primarily due to the decreased amount of organic crop that can be grown per hectare. Long story short, organic is not necessarily better and GMOs have not proven to pose any health risk to date.

GMOs have undergone more detailed evaluation than any other group of plants that we consume. In almost all cases, GMOs differ from a conventional plant by the addition of just one or two genes that produce one or two new proteins. The origin and function of these proteins are well understood. For example, the proteins are studied to make sure they do not have any characteristics that are likely to cause allergic reactions. The National Academy for Science, the United States’ number one source for independent, objective advice to the nation on matters of science and technology, concluded that GMOs are safe for human health. The same conclusion has been reached by a large number of prestigious health and science organizations from around the world. In addition, over the two decades that GMOs have been on the market, there have been no occurrences of health issues due to genetically modified organisms.

Much the same applies to beef, while grass fed beef is very lean, it's the fat content (marbling) of the grain fed cows that give it tenderness, juiciness, and most importantly taste. As for chicken, its a personal choice, I have no problem eating chicken that is non organic and GMO grain fed (there is zero scientific evidence that GMO feed is harmful to chickens or their meat is to consume by humans). I do prefer the breeds of meat chickens (called broilers in the chicken industry) that was commonly sold in the US in the mid 1980s and before, then commercial chicken growers switched over to the Conish Cross breed of chickens because they grow very big, very quickly, making them the most profitable. Cornish Crosses don't really taste like anything, they are close to being flavorless. 

 I do stay away from ""pumped"" chicken, that is chicken that is injected with sodium phosphate (salt compounds) solution to retain water and juiciness. Again, this is done for profitability (known as ""value added"" in the chicken processing industry). While no evidence that sodium phosphate is harmful to humans in small quantities (unless you have hypertension), it is sometimes used in medicine as a laxative.

No chicken sold in the US is GMO or given is growth hormones, It's use is strictly forbidden by the FDA and USDA since the 1950s. Some brands of chicken put ""Free of Growth Hormones"" on their labels, they're just playing upon consumer fears in their marketing, marketing is of course, full of buzzwords, they often play upon trends and the fears of uneducated consumers.

I lived in Tennessee that was pretty much how all the cows were raised, and now with all the supply chain ridiculousness going on people will probably need to start looking to local farms and processors to get meet regularly. The stores still have it from time to time but the price is going up and a lot of the times I go to the store and they’re just out. 

Another thing with the blade cut meat, one of the problems is during the pandemic they close processing plants down and sort of attacked the meat industry and you had a lot of farmers having to make the decision what to do with their cows when they went past processing age, one they were forced to sell off to The large factory processors or start processing themselves in places where it became political and the processors were shut down.  They probably started blade cutting them because they weren’t as tender and we’re older because this went on for several months and is starting again.  I noticed for a long time that beef got very tough and almost an edible, even the more expensive cuts that were marveled well because it was older Beef that should’ve been processed much earlier.  Now I’m not sure what’s happening, I know that small farms and companies like butcher block and those that ship from local processors are picking up in business as the stores don’t have all the stuff readily available in a lot of places but it will be interesting to see where all of this leads. :/   What I suggest is that people load up on it when they find the sales and places like Aldi‘s and Costco and get as much as they can store or freeze now because they may just be facing times ahead when they just can’t get food supplied properly because our government is run by a bunch of clowns.  :/

I’d rather enjoy a nice black angus beef burger where the steer eats grass 85% of its life and the remaining 15% corn. These burgers are much tastier in my opinion. The cattle actually prefer to eat corn because of taste and is easier for them to digest.

It’s a bit hypocritical wouldn’t you say ? USDA prime beef comes from steers that’s been grain finished . Cuz of the supermarket chains and some lazy farmers we’re getting deceived about our beef as they’re endorsing grass finished beef . So far it’s not proven that grass finished beef are healthier than grain finished beef . Grass finished beef doesn’t normally come to grading criteria cuz it doesn’t get that high quality to be graded. Of course if any feedlot feeding gmo grain to the cattle then that’s not good but here in Australia our top beef producers and feedlots never use gmo grain . Because of these clueless advertisements about grass finished beef we’re producing way less prime quality beef . I saw you bobby making a video about Japanese wagyu , the irony is you like wagyu but that wagyu is been eating grain it’s entire life . So please don’t follow what the supermarket tells you rather guide your followers with scientific evidences . The purpose of feedlot isn’t quickly achieve targeted weight gain of the animal, rather most of the time it’s to achieve the targeted quality . Without finishing the steers on grain based diet we can never get prime quality beef . Every harvested steer eats grass at least 70 to 80% of its life, it’s the last 100 to 200 days that either it’s finished on grain or grass . So we’re always getting deceived by the supermarkets about this issue.

This guy seems to know a lot about meat, and has many good suggestions, but that said, he falls for all the psuedo-science marketing. He is correct, regarding the poor farming practices for the seafood, but he doesnt mention that wild-caught often can have worms/parasites. Not a problem if you cook it through, but dont use it for a poke bowl. Furthermore, there's nothing wrong with GMO - show me any legit science study that supports non-GMO - its a complete marketing scam. You are throwing out your money if you pay a penny extra for it. Same as those certified animal treatment labels. Same chickens can wind up in either bag. Don't take my word for it, or his word to the contrary - be skeptical - and research yourself. Organic farming (which does use chemicals and pesticides contrary to the marketing spin) and non-GMO products waste farmland and are not sustainable. Then he points to big words like ""carrageenan"" and others - scary stuff unless you know that ""carrageenan"" is vegan gelatin that comes from edible seaweed. And its not a filler (as he says) - its in the SEASONING, the last ingredient, which is the least ingredient. I'm not going to cover all the ingredient BS he's ignorantly spewing, else I'll end up writing a book. And lastly, he is scaring people away from Costco steaks because of the ""blade tenderized"" when there is a simple solution. Sous Vide your steak and no worries. The extended low-temp (129) cooking time of sous vide will kill dangerous bacteria, even in the center of the meat, yet the relatively short sous vide times for prime steaks (60-90m) allows for sous vide without any special equipment - just a small ice chest, a ziplock bag, and a thermometer. Enjoy your next informed Costco visit :)

Otherwise your eatting the same as the guy buying the cheepest bird he can find...  As to Organic beef, thats the biggest scam of all...  Grass fed even worse.   First grass fed should be cheeper...
